## Create branch
After an issue created, by typing `/b [type] [branchName]` on the issue comment, a new branch will be created.

* `[type]: feature, hotfix, etc...` and `branchName` should be sparated by space like: `update system`

### ex.
`/b feature change format` (on issue #237) -> branch name will be: `feature/#237_change_format` 

### setup
Clone `.github` folder on a repository (any).
